# snmpd.conf:
#   An example configuration file for configuring the ucd-snmp snmpd agent.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This file is intended to only be as a starting point.  Many more
# configuration directives exist than are mentioned in this file.  For 
# full details, see the snmpd.conf(5) manual page.
#
# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are intended for you
# to read.  All other lines are configuration commands for the agent.

# Access Control
###############################################################################

# As shipped, the snmpd demon will only respond to queries on the
# system mib group until this file is replaced or modified for
# security purposes.  Examples are shown below about how to increase the
# level of access.

# By far, the most common question I get about the agent is "why won't
# it work?", when really it should be "how do I configure the agent to
# allow me to access it?"
#
# By default, the agent responds to the "public" community for read
# only access, if run out of the box without any configuration file in 
# place.  The following examples show you other ways of configuring
# the agent so that you can change the community names, and give
# yourself write access to the mib tree as well.
#
# For more information, read the FAQ as well as the snmpd.conf(5)
# manual page.

####
# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"

#       sec.name  source          community
com2sec notConfigUser  default       public

####
# Second, map the security name into a group name:

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser
group   notConfigGroup v2c           notConfigUser

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

# Make at least  snmpwalk -v 1 localhost -c public system fast again.
#       name           incl/excl     subtree         mask(optional)
view    systemview    included   .1
view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1

####
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here is a commented out example configuration that allows less
# restrictive access.

# YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE "COMMUNITY" TOKEN BELOW TO A NEW KEYWORD ONLY
# KNOWN AT YOUR SITE.  YOU *MUST* CHANGE THE NETWORK TOKEN BELOW TO
# SOMETHING REFLECTING YOUR LOCAL NETWORK ADDRESS SPACE.

##       sec.name  source          community
#com2sec local     localhost       COMMUNITY
#com2sec mynetwork NETWORK/24      COMMUNITY

##     group.name sec.model  sec.name
#group MyRWGroup  any        local
#group MyROGroup  any        mynetwork
#
#group MyRWGroup  any        otherv3user
#...

##           incl/excl subtree                          mask
#view all    included  .1                               80

## -or just the mib2 tree-

#view mib2   included  .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2 fc


##                context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
#access MyROGroup ""      any       noauth    0      all    none   none
#access MyRWGroup ""      any       noauth    0      all    all    all

# Sample configuration to make net-snmpd RFC 1213.
# Unfortunately v1 and v2c don't allow any user based authentification, so
# opening up the default config is not an option from a security point.
#
# WARNING: If you uncomment the following lines you allow write access to your
# snmpd daemon from any source! To avoid this use different names for your
# community or split out the write access to a different community and 
# restrict it to your local network.
# Also remember to comment the syslocation and syscontact parameters later as
# otherwise they are still read only (see FAQ for net-snmp).
#

# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"
#       sec.name        source          community
#com2sec notConfigUser   default         public

# Second, map the security name into a group name:
#       groupName       securityModel   securityName
#group   notConfigGroup  v1              notConfigUser
#group   notConfigGroup  v2c             notConfigUser


# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.
#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
#access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  roview rwview none



###############################################################################
# System contact information
#

# It is also possible to set the sysContact and sysLocation system
# variables through the snmpd.conf file:

syslocation Noida (edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf)
syscontact Root <root@localhost> (configure /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf)


# Added for support of bcm5820 cards.
pass .1 /usr/bin/ucd5820stat
